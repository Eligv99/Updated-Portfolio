            <p>
                My name is Eliezer Giovanni Vazquez Figueroa. I was born on December 27, 1999, in Bellvile, New Jersey but when I was four years old I moved to the small but amazing island of Puerto Rico. I lived in Puerto Rico for 13 years. I speak two languages, English and Spanish, very fluent on both. I love to do many things from sleeping to watching sports. My favorite hobbie is considered to be playing my favorite sport which is soccer. A year ago I moved to this country and learned to live under this culture and life style. After I graduated from North Arlington High School, I started to work in a Auto Body Shop and I have decided to take a turn in life with this course to create my own legacy.
